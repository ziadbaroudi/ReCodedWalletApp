# ReCodedWalletApp
The app should be able to manage multiple wallets
A wallet has a name, starting balance, a list of Transactions, and description
The wallets should be saved and loaded from a storage (with thier data)
There should be 2 types of transactions (Income and Expense)
A transaction should have a date, tags, and a note
a user can jump between the wallets and create wallets
